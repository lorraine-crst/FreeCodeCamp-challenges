        Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty projects and six major
        programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term "software engineering".

      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dra. Margaret life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1936</strong>- was born in Paoli, Indiana</li>
        <li><strong>1954</strong>- Margaret graduated from Hancock High School</li>
        <li><strong>1958</strong>- she earned a BA in mathematics with a minor in philosophy</li>
        <li><strong>1958</strong>- While at Earlham, Hamilton met her first husband, James Cox Hamilton</li>
        <li><strong>1959</strong>- they had a daughter, Lauren, born on November 10, 1959</li>
        <li><strong>1959</strong>- Hamilton began working for Edward Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at
          MIT.</li>
        <li><strong>From 1961 to 1963</strong> - Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project
          at the MIT Lincoln Lab</li>
        <li><strong>Apollo11</strong>- the Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software averted
          an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several
          computer alarms were triggered. The on-board flight software captured these alarms with the "never supposed to
          happen displays" interrupting the astronauts with priority alarm displays.</li>
        <li><strong>Em 1976</strong> - Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher Order Software
          (HOS)[46] to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience
          at MIT working on the Apollo program</li>
        <li><strong>2021</strong>- On the day this site was made she is still alive, 85 years old</li>
      </ul>
